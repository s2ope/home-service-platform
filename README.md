# 🏠 Home Service Platform

A web-based Home Service Platform that connects users with local service providers such as plumbers, electricians, cleaners, and other professionals through an easy-to-use online booking system.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Home Service Platform is designed to simplify the process of finding and booking trusted home service providers. Users can browse services, select preferred time slots, and manage bookings, while service providers can manage their schedules and service requests through a dedicated dashboard.

This project demonstrates the complete software development process including requirement analysis, system design, development, testing, and deployment.
